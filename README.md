Internship concept/Front-end boilerplate (client side) + NodeJs/ExpressJs (server side)

This project was developed with the help of a boilerplate that you can find on https://github.com/mirabeau-nl/frontend-boilerplate
and ExpressJs Framework was used for rendering the pages on the server-side.

Start:
1. Install node modules => npm install 
2. Install nodemon with gulp, in order to automatically save the changes on server side => npm install --save-dev gulp-nodemon
3. Install expressJs framework => npm install express
4. Install package for newsApi to get the desired information => All the installation process you can find on https://newsapi.org/docs , also you can generate your APIKey.

Afterward, you can start gulp task "dev" to check the solution without server-side rendering otherwise you can start the "server" task to get the sources from your API into the templates.
